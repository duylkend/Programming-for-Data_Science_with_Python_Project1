1. What are the movies that families  watching?
	SELECT 
		f.title AS "Film Title",
		c.name AS "Category Name",
		COUNT(r.rental_id) AS "Count of Rentals"
	FROM 
		film AS f
	JOIN 
		film_category AS fc ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
	JOIN 
		category AS c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
	JOIN 
		inventory AS i ON f.film_id = i.film_id
	JOIN 
		rental AS r ON i.inventory_id = r.inventory_id
	WHERE 
		c.name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
	GROUP BY 
		f.title, c.name
	ORDER BY 
		c.name, f.title;
		
		
2.	Can you provide a table with the movie titles and divide them into 4 levels (first_quarter, second_quarter, third_quarter, and final_quarter) based on the quartiles (25%, 50%, 75%) of the average rental duration(in the number of days) for movies across all categories?

	WITH movie_rental_duration AS (
		SELECT 
			f.title AS "title",
			c.name AS "name",
			f.rental_duration AS "rental_duration"
		FROM 
			film AS f
		JOIN 
			film_category AS fc ON f.film_id = fc.film_id
		JOIN 
			category AS c ON fc.category_id = c.category_id
	)
	, quartiles AS (
		SELECT 
			title, 
			name,
			rental_duration,
			NTILE(4) OVER (ORDER BY rental_duration) AS standard_quartile
		FROM 
			movie_rental_duration
	)
	SELECT
		title,
		name,
		rental_duration,
		standard_quartile
	FROM 
		quartiles
	WHERE 
		name IN ('Animation', 'Children', 'Classics', 'Comedy', 'Family', 'Music')
	ORDER BY 
		standard_quartile, title;

3. How do the two stores compare in their count of rental orders for each month across all available years in the dataset?
	SELECT 
		s.store_id,
		EXTRACT(YEAR FROM r.rental_date) AS rental_year,
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM r.rental_date) AS rental_month,
		COUNT(r.rental_id) AS rental_count
	FROM 
		rental r
	JOIN 
		inventory i ON r.inventory_id = i.inventory_id
	JOIN 
		store s ON i.store_id = s.store_id
	GROUP BY 
		s.store_id, 
		EXTRACT(YEAR FROM r.rental_date), 
		EXTRACT(MONTH FROM r.rental_date)
	ORDER BY 
		s.store_id, 
		rental_year, 
		rental_month;

4. What are the customer names, the month and year of payment, and the total payment amount for each month for the top 10 paying customers?
	SELECT 
		c.first_name || ' ' || c.last_name AS customer_name,
		TO_CHAR(p.payment_date, 'YYYY-MM') AS month_year,
		COUNT(1) AS count_payment,
		SUM(p.amount) AS total_payment
	FROM 
		customer c
	JOIN 
		payment p ON c.customer_id = p.customer_id
	WHERE 
		c.customer_id IN (
			SELECT 
				customer_id
			FROM 
				payment
			GROUP BY 
				customer_id
			ORDER BY 
				SUM(amount) DESC
			LIMIT 10
		)
	AND 
		TO_CHAR(p.payment_date, 'YYYY') = '2007'
	GROUP BY 
		customer_name, month_year
	ORDER BY 
		customer_name, month_year;
